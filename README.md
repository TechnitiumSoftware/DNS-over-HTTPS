# DNS-over-HTTPS

An implementation of RFC 8484 - DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH).

This project allows hosting a DoH web service using ASP.NET or ASP.NETCore that can transform any DNS server to be accessible via the DoH standard protocol.

This can be combined with Technitium DNS Server to provide DoH protocol support.
